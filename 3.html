<h2> list</h2>
<p>
A list is a number of items in an ordered or unordered structure. A list can be used for a number of things like storing items or deleting and adding items. But for the programmer to perform the different tasks for the list, the program must have enough memory to keep up with changes done to the list. There are different sort of lists which are linear list and linked list. Also, the list can be referred to as an abstract data type.
